      </p>
      <h3 dir="ltr">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
      <p>
        The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you

      <p>
        Data Generated from Shopping with Darkstore. We may collect information
        that is generated when you search or shop for products using the

        that you browse, items that you view, items that you place on your wish
        list, your interests, and other information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automatic Data Collection. We may collect certain information
        automatically when you use the Services. This information may include
        your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie
        identifiers, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details
        about your browser, operating system or device, location information
        (including inferred location based off of your IP address), Internet
        service provider, mobile carrier, pages that you visit before, during
        and after using the Services, information about the links you click,

        Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information. We, as well
        as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other
        functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local
        storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically
        collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially
        small data files placed on your device that allow us and our partners to
        record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with
        our Services.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to
            store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete
            cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work
            properly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is
            a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information
            about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us
            to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web
            page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include
            web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been
            opened, acted on, or forwarded.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Analytics. We may use Google Analytics and other service providers to
        collect and process analytics information on our Services. For more
        information about how Google uses data, please visit

      </p>

      <h4>Information from Other Sources</h4>

        third party services and organizations. For example, if you access our
        Services through a third-party application, such as a social networking

        application that you have made available via your privacy settings.

        your personal information with the Brand whose products you have
        purchased. Once your personal information has been shared with the
        Brand, it will also be subject to the Brand’s privacy policy and the
        Brand may use your personal information for its own purposes, including
        to send you marketing materials. We encourage you to closely read the
        Brand’s privacy policy before placing an order. Please note that we do

        about you with our third-party service providers. The categories of
        service providers to whom we entrust personal information include

        collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g.,
        your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of
        day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar

      <p>
        We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no system is 100%
        secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
        you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws,
        we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure.
