# Terms of Service

# Last Updated: 9/27/2022

Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our [Privacy Policy](https://tos.fastaf.com/fastaf_privacy) (“Privacy Policy”) carefully because they govern your use of FastAF Technologies, Inc. (“FastAF”)’s mobile application (“App”) and the purchase of any product offered for sale by FastAF via the App (each such product, a “Product”). To make these Terms easier to read, the App and our online store are collectively called the “Services.”

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND FASTAF THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 16 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.

Agreement to Terms. By using our Services or purchasing a Product on the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services or make any Product purchase.

Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services and Product purchases on the App, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.

Changes to these Terms or the Services. We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services or make a purchase on the App. If you continue to use the Services or make a Product purchase after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services or make purchases on the App anymore. The only exception is for changes to the “Dispute Resolution” section, for which you have followed the process in Section 16(g). Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

Who May Use the Services? You may use the Services or make a purchase on the App only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with FastAF, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law. For certain features of the Services you’ll need an account. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account. To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

Feedback. We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.

Terms of Sale.

(a) End Users Only. You must be an end user to purchase Products on the App. Resellers are not eligible for purchase. We reserve the right to limit quantities purchased per person or per order.

(b) Order Acceptance and Cancellation. You agree that your order is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all Products listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will not be obligated to sell the Products to you. We may choose not to accept orders at our sole discretion, including if we are unable to obtain authorization for payment, shipping restrictions apply to a particular Product, or the Product(s) you order are out of stock.

(c) Pricing. All prices posted on the App are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a Product will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed. Price increases will only apply to orders placed after such changes. We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of subsequent price decreases or promotions. Posted prices do not include taxes or delivery charges. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email. We strive to display accurate price information, however we may, on occasion, make inadvertent typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions related to pricing and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to cancel any orders arising from such occurrences.

(d) Payment. When you submit an order for a Product (each, a “Transaction”), you expressly authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge you for such Transaction. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction and to charge your payment method for the type of Transaction you have selected (plus any applicable taxes and other charges). You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). By initiating a Transaction, you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to such fees and charges, as posted or otherwise communicated to you. All payments for Transactions are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms. All fees and applicable taxes, if any, are payable in United States dollars.

(e) Delivery. Please refer to (https://res.cloudinary.com/fastaf/raw/upload/v1600360149/legal/FasttAF_Delivery_Policy.docx) for our delivery policy. We are responsible for each purchase that you make during the time the Product is in transit until it is delivered to your specified delivery address. Once a Product is delivered to your delivery address, responsibility for the purchased Product passes to you.

(f) Returns and Refunds. Please refer to (https://res.cloudinary.com/fastaf/image/upload/v1655839344/Return_Refund_Policy_2022_qx0jnd.pdf) for our returns policy.

(g) Refer-a-Friend Code. From time to time, FastAF may offer a promotional code that you may share with friends for use on the App (“Refer-a-Friend Code”). For purposes of this Section 6(g), when you share your Refer-a-Friend Code with a person, you are considered a “Referrer” and the person who received your Refer-a-Friend Code is considered a “Referred User”. The Referred User may redeem the Refer-a-Friend Code towards his/her first purchase of Products on the App, provided that such purchase has a total value of at least $35 (excluding tasex, delivery fees and any other charges)(for clarity, the Refer-a-Friend Code cannot be used on subsequent purchases by the Referred User). When a Referred User makes a purchase using your Refer-a-Friend Code, you will be awarded a credit in the amount of $20, which you may redeem towards a purchase of Products on the App (credits are not redeemable for cash or any cash equivalent). Refer-a-Friend Codes (i) are non-transferable, (ii) cannot be combined with other promotions, discounts or offers, and (iii) cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent. FastAF reserves the right to change the terms applicable to Refer-a-Friend Codes at any time, in its sole descretion.

(h) Other Promotional Codes. From time to time, FastAF may offer other promotional codes that are redeemable towards a purchase of Products (“Promo Codes”). Please review the terms provided with each Promo Code for eligibility and other applicable terms and conditions, which may include expiration dates, minimum purchase amounts or other restrictions or limitations. Only valid Promo Codes issued by FastAF will be honored by FastAF. Each Promo Code offered by FastAF (i) is non-transferable, (ii) is valid for one single purchase on the App, (iii) cannot be combined with other promotions, discounts or offers (including the Refer-a-Friend Codes), and (iv) cannot be redeemed for cash or any cash equivalent. FastAF is not responsible for any unauthorized use of Promo Codes or for any promotional codes you received from any other site or source. The monetary value of the Promo Code will not be refunded or credited back if the Product purchased using the Promo Code is returned. Promo Codes are void if copied, transferred, sold, exchanged or expired, and where prohibited.

Warranty Disclaimers.

(a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICES AND ALL PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any information or content on the Services.

(b) We do not manufacture or control any of the Products offered for sale on the App. The availability of Products through the App does not indicate an affiliation with or endorsement of any Product or manufacturer. Accordingly, we do not provide any warranties with respect to the Products. However, the Products may be covered by the manufacturer’s warranty as detailed in the Product’s description on the App and included with the Product. To obtain warranty service for defective Products, please follow the instructions included in the manufacturer’s warranty.

Limitation of Liability.

(a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER FASTAF NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR THE PRODUCTS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANY PRODUCT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT FASTAF OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS OR SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

(b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL FASTAF’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR THE PRODUCTS EXCEED (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION, OR FOR USE OF THE SERVICES (AS APPLICABLE), OR (B) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO FASTAF, AS APPLICABLE.

(c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN FASTAF AND YOU.

Governing Law and Forum Choice. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 16 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and FastAF are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and FastAF each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

Dispute Resolution.

(a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or any Products (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and FastAF agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and FastAF are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

(b) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 16(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.

(c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

(d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

(e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

(f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND FASTAF AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

(g) Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 “Changes to Terms or Services” above, if FastAF changes any of the terms of this Section 16 “Dispute Resolution” after the date you most recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@fastaf.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of FastAF’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FastAF in accordance with the terms of this Section 16 “Dispute Resolution” as of the date you most recently accepted these Terms.

(h) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(e) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

General Terms.

(a) Reservation of Rights. FastAF and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.

(b) Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between FastAF and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between FastAF and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without FastAF’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. FastAF may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

(c) Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by FastAF under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

(d) Waiver of Rights. FastAF’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of FastAF. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Contact Information. If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact FastAF at support@fastaf.com.

Furthermore, we reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion, to block access to the Services, in whole or in part, from any geographic location, IP addresses and unique device identifiers or to any user who we believe is in breach of these Terms.



5. **About the Services.** Our Services facilitate interaction with certain decentralized cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control (each, a “**Protocol**”). Our Services also facilitate the creation of a digital wallet (“**FastAF Wallet**”) through third-party services, such as Magic.Link, that we do not own and control that enable you to self-custody and manage Supported Digital Assets (as defined below) and interact with third-party services and supported Protocols and support the sale, purchase, trade and distribution of Supported Digital Assets on the decentralized blockchains on which the Supported Digital Assets are recorded (each, a “**Blockchain**”).

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time in connection with any transaction as required by applicable law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating these Terms or the terms of any third-party service provider.  Such suspension or termination shall not constitute a breach of these Terms by  FastAF. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose reasonable limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Services.

14. **Assumption of Risk**.  You acknowledge, accept, and assume the following risks:


    a. The prices and liquidity of cryptocurrency assets (including the Supported Digital Assets) are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Supported Digital Assets made available through the Services, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.
    
    b. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, Taxes and Gas Fees apply to your transactions through the Services.  FastAF is not responsible for determining or paying the Taxes or Gas Fees that apply to such transactions.
    
    c. Supported Digital Assets are digital assets recorded and transferable on the supporting Blockchain. Any transfer of digital assets occurs within the supporting Blockchain, which is not controlled in any capacity by  FastAF. Transactions involving Supported Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions involving Supported Digital Assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction. 
    
    d. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services and the utility of Supported Digital Assets. 
    
    e. There are risks associated with using Internet-based digital asset, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.  FastAF will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when effecting transactions involving Supported Digital Assets, however caused, including Gas Fees paid or payable in connection therewith. 
    
    f. Technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Services, which could result in the theft or loss of your Supported Digital Assets.
    
    g. By accessing and using the Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of digital assets. Such systems may have vulnerabilities or other failures, or other abnormal behavior.  FastAF is not responsible for any issues with the Blockchains, including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Solana are variable and may increase at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to or from the Services. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing Services. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing, using and interacting with the Services.



15. **Indemnity.** You will indemnify, defend (at  FastAF’ option) and hold  FastAF and its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Services or (b) your violation of these Terms.

16. **Limitation of Liability.**


    a. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER FASTAF NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT FASTAF OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    b. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE TOTAL LIABILITY OF FASTAF AND ITS AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, AND AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO FASTAF FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO FASTAF, AS APPLICABLE. 
    
    c. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN FASTAF AND YOU.



17. **Governing Law and Forum Choice.** These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and  FastAF are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and FastAF each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.


18. **Dispute Resolution.**


    a. **Informal Resolution of Disputes**.  You and FastAF must first attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “**Disputes**”) informally.  Accordingly, neither you nor FastAF may start a formal arbitration proceeding or other dispute resolution provision for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing.  As part of this informal resolution process, you must deliver your written notices via hand or first-class mail to us at FastAF, Attn: support@fast.com. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights at any time.
    
    b. **Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes**. We each agree that any Dispute will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and FastAF agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and FastAF are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. 
    
    c. **Exceptions**. As limited exceptions to Section 17(b) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. 
    
    d. **Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules**. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175). 
    
    e. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
    
    f. **Arbitration Costs**. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
    
    g. **Injunctive and Declaratory Relief**. Except as provided in Section 17(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
    
    h. **Class Action Waiver**. **YOU AND FASTAF AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
    
    i. **Severability**. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(g) of these Terms (“**Class Action Waiver**”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.



19. **General Terms.**


    a. **Reservation of Rights**.  FastAF and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.
    
    b. **Entire Agreement**. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between  FastAF and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between  FastAF and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without  FastAF’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, without such consent, will be null.  FastAF may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    
    c. **Notices**. Any notices or other communications provided by  FastAF under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
    
    d. **Waiver of Rights**.  FastAF’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of  FastAF. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
