# **Terms of Service**
## **Last Updated: [5/5/2020]**

Please read these Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) and our [Privacy Policy](https://res.cloudinary.com/fastaf/raw/upload/v1600360149/legal/FastAF_Privacy_Policy.docx) (“**Privacy Policy**”) carefully because they govern your use of Darkstore, Inc. (“**Darkstore**”)’s mobile application (“**App**”) and the purchase of any product offered for sale by Darkstore via the App (each such product, a “**Product**”). To make these Terms easier to read, the App and our online store are collectively called the “**Services.**”

**IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND DARKSTORE THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 16 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.**

1. **Agreement to Terms.** By using our Services or purchasing a Product on the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services or make any Product purchase.

2. **Privacy Policy.** Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Services and Product purchases on the App, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.

3. **Changes to these Terms or the Services.** We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services or make a purchase on the App. If you continue to use the Services or make a Product purchase after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services or make purchases on the App anymore. The only exception is for changes to the “Dispute Resolution” section, for which you have followed the process in Section 16(g). Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

4. **Who May Use the Services?** You may use the Services or make a purchase on the App only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with Darkstore, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law. For certain features of the Services you’ll need an account. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account. To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

5. **Feedback.** We appreciate feedback, comments, ideas, proposals and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“**Feedback**”). If you choose to submit Feedback, you agree that we are free to use it without any restriction or compensation to you.

    (b) __Order Acceptance and Cancellation__. You agree that your order is an offer to buy, under these Terms, all Products listed in your order. All orders must be accepted by us or we will not be obligated to sell the Products to you.

Posted prices do not include taxes or delivery charges. All such taxes and charges will be added to your merchandise total, and will be itemized in your shopping cart and in your order confirmation email.

    (b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL DARKSTORE’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES  OR THE PRODUCTS EXCEED (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION, OR FOR USE OF THE SERVICES (AS APPLICABLE), OR (B) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO DARKSTORE, AS APPLICABLE. 

    (c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN DARKSTORE AND YOU.

15. **Governing Law and Forum Choice.** These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 16 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Darkstore are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and Darkstore each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

16. **Dispute Resolution.**

    (a) __Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes__. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or any Products (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and Darkstore agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Darkstore are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms. 

    (b) __Exceptions__. As limited exceptions to Section 16(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. 

    (c) __Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules__. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. 
    
    Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
    
    (d) __Arbitration Costs__. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

    (e) __Injunctive and Declaratory Relief__. Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

    (f) __Class Action Waiver__. **YOU AND DARKSTORE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**  Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

    (g) __Effect of Changes on Arbitration__. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 “Changes to Terms or Services” above, if Darkstore changes any of the terms of this Section 16 “Dispute Resolution” after the date you most recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [support@fastaf.com]) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Darkstore’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Darkstore in accordance with the terms of this Section 16 “Dispute Resolution” as of the date you most recently accepted these Terms.

    (h) __Severability__. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 16(e) of these Terms ("**Class Action Waiver**"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

17. **General Terms.**

    (a) __Reservation of Rights__. Darkstore and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries.

    (b) __Entire Agreement__.

If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Darkstore’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Darkstore may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

    (c) __Notices__. Any notices or other communications provided by Darkstore under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

    (d) __Waiver of Rights__. Darkstore’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Darkstore. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
